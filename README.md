## 📈 Key Metrics and Formulas

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the campaign's performance, the following key metrics were calculated using custom columns:

* **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Measures how often users clicked on the ads.
    * `CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) * 100`

* **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: Measures the cost of each click.
    * `CPC = Spend / Clicks`

* **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Measures the profitability of the campaign.
    * `ROI = (Approved Conversions - Spend) / Spend`
